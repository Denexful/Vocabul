# Vocabul

The source code is not documented. I've not found the time yet. Anyway i explain a little bit about the specific Tabs and functions in the UI.

Feel free to review this code! 

###Editor

In the Editor you got a new "vocable group" called "rename this!". As you might know, you shall rename this to your custom voable group name.
After you renamed your lession, you cann write into the left column ,for example, "Hello" and into the right column "Hallo". If you finished this click save (the button 
with the red border) and the app saves your new lession group in the SQLITE database. 

Of course you can add / delete and edit your vocables. DO NOT FROGET TO SAVE YOUR CHANGES

Play little bit with this editor and report bugs!

###List

Here are your saved groups. This view ist just for open the groups and have a look whats in there.

###Select

As you may suggest, here you can select your custom group to take a test with it


###Test

on the bottom you will find 3 symbols. This 3 symbols are modes.
* Left mode (on the left side): all columns on the left side are empty and you have to guess what the correct vocable is ;)
* Middle mode: left and right columns are randomly empty 
* Right mode: all columns on the right are empty

Click on the Play button to start the test

After finish you will find anoter view:

###Evaluation

you will see. there is an number. +1 -1.

This number is a counter, he counts how many times you misspelled a vocable. Min value is 0. Of course you can edit this number in the editor and watch how big the number is in the list tab/view
