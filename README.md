# Vocabul

The source code is not documented. I've not found the time yet. Anyway I explain a little about the specific Tabs and functions in the UI.

Feel free to review this code! 

## Editor

In the Editor you got a new "vocable group" called "rename this!". As you might know, you shall rename this to your custom vocable group name.
After you renamed your lesson, you can write into the left column, for example, "Hello" and into the right column "Hallo". If you finished this click save (the button 
with the red border) and the app saves your new lesson group in the SQLITE database. 

Of course, you can add / delete and edit your vocables. DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE YOUR CHANGES

Play little with this editor and report bugs!

## List

Here are your saved groups. This view is just for open the groups and have a look what's in there.

## Select

As you may suggest, here you can select your custom group to take a test with it


## Test

On the bottom you will find 3 symbols. This 3 symbols are modes.
* Left mode (on the left side): all columns on the left side are empty and you have to guess what the correct vocable is ;)
* Middle mode: left and right columns are randomly empty 
* Right mode: all columns on the right are empty

Click on the Play button to start the test

After finish, you will find another view:

###Evaluation

You will see. There is a number. +1 -1.

This number is a counter, he counts how many times you misspelled a vocable. Min value is 0. Of course, you can edit this number in the editor and watch how big the number is in the list tab/view.
